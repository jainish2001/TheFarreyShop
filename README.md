How It Works
Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark modes using a toggle switch. The choice is saved in the browser's localStorage and applied automatically on page load.

Dynamic Resources: Buttons on the page link to various resources, including PDFs and videos. These links can be modified to cater to different exams.

Cross-Window Communication: The main page and the iframe communicate to synchronize the theme across both.
