<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<i>Welcome to The Farrey Shop! This project is a web application designed to assist students with various theory and lab exams by providing easy access to relevant resources. The main features include:</i>

<h3>Dark Mode Toggle:</h3> A convenient switch to toggle between light and dark themes for better user experience. The theme preference is saved using localStorage, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions.

<h3>Dynamic Button Links:</h3> The website includes buttons that link to different theory and lab exam resources. These links can be updated as per the requirements of different exams, making it a versatile tool for academic support.


<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Responsive Design:</h3> The layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.

<h3>Smooth Transitions:</h3> Aesthetic transitions for theme changes and animations enhance the overall user experience.

<h3>LocalStorage Integration:</h3> The selected theme (light or dark) is remembered across sessions, providing a personalized experience.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul><li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li></ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<h3>Dark Mode Toggle:</h3> Users can switch between light and dark modes using a toggle switch. The choice is saved in the browser's localStorage and applied automatically on page load.

<h3>Dynamic Resources:</h3> Buttons on the page link to various resources, including PDFs and videos. These links can be modified to cater to different exams.

<h3>Cross-Window Communication:</h3> The main page and the iframe communicate to synchronize the theme across both.
